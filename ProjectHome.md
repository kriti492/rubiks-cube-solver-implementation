This is an self-training project.
When the first time I am trying to understand the algorithm under the "Rubik's cube solver" available on Internet , I found several methods.  However, the one I choose is the variation of IDA`*` which can let me apply the knowledge from AI class.

At first, I think this project will be "a piece of cake".  After I doing some research, I found that I was wrong.  The theory mention in papers lacks implementation detail.  The critical data-structure didn't specify in papers, too.

For this sack, **this project is trying to filled up the "gap" between theory and practical program.**
